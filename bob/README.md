# ORMIT RSpec training

Follow along with our weekly RSpec training. The master branch will always be
at whatever state we left the code the previous week.

## Acceptance criteria

Based on the "Bob" exercise from [Exercism](http://exercism.io). Adapted to use
RSpec.

Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very
limited.

- Bob answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.
- He answers 'Woah, chill out!' if you yell at him.
- He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying
  anything.
- He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.

## Getting started

- Clone this repository to your computer
- Open your terminal application and `cd` into the repository's directory
- On your command line, run `bundle install` to install the RSpec gem
- Run `rspec` to see the current state of the test suite

## Getting around

- The test code is in *spec/bob_spec.rb*
- The application code is in *lib/bob.rb*
